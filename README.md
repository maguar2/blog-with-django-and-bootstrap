This blog was built using DJango/Python and all the pages dealing with the UI interaction are contained in the myblog folder and members folder 
where members also contain the user authentication pages such as Login, Password change form, Contact Form and the rest of them. For now, there 
is no way to recover Password via Email as this is a dummy Project but it contains majority of the semantics so employed in blog development.
Feel free to skim through, fork, revise and contribute to your heart fill.
